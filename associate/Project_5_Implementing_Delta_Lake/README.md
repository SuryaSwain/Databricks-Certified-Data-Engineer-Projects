# Project 5: Implementing Delta Lake

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the ETL pipeline using Delta Lake features. The objective is to demonstrate how to convert DataFrames to Delta Tables, implement time travel, and optimize data storage in Delta Lake.

## Objectives

- Convert Spark DataFrames to Delta Tables to leverage Delta Lake functionalities.
- Implement time travel features to access previous versions of data.
- Optimize data storage and performance using Delta Lake.

## Available Data Source

- Use the data created from **Project 3: ETL Process with Spark**.

## Files in This Project

- **delta_lake_implementation.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of Delta Lake features and optimizations.
- **delta_table_schema.json**: JSON file representing the schema of the Delta Table (if applicable).
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages to run the project.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required packages using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook delta_lake_implementation.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to implement Delta Lake features and optimizations.
