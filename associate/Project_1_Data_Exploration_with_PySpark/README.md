# Project 1: Data Exploration with PySpark


## Overview

This project focuses on exploring the Titanic dataset using PySpark. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and visualize insights. The analysis will help inform decisions regarding data preprocessing for further modeling tasks.


## Objectives

- Load the Titanic dataset into a PySpark DataFrame.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and insights.
- Visualize findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.


## Available Data Source

- [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)


## Files in This Project

- **titanic_data_exploration.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data exploration and analysis workflow.
- **titanic_data_analysis.py** (optional): A Python script with functions for data analysis that can be executed separately.
- **titanic_visualizations.png**: Image file containing visualizations created during the analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages to run the project.


## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required packages using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook titanic_data_exploration.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform data exploration and visualization.
