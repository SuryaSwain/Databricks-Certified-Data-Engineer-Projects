# Project 6: Performance Tuning in Spark

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing Spark jobs for better performance. It involves analyzing Spark job performance metrics, identifying bottlenecks, and applying various optimizations such as partitioning, caching, and tuning configurations.

## Objectives

- Analyze the performance of Spark jobs using Spark UI and metrics.
- Identify performance bottlenecks in the Spark application.
- Implement optimizations to improve the efficiency of Spark jobs.

## Available Data Source

- Use data generated from **Project 3: ETL Process with Spark** or **Project 5: Implementing Delta Lake**.

## Files in This Project

- **performance_tuning_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis of Spark job performance and the optimizations applied.
- **performance_metrics_report.pdf**: A report summarizing the performance metrics before and after optimizations.
- **tuning_configurations.json**: JSON file detailing the configuration settings applied to optimize Spark jobs.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages to run the project.
