# Project 8: Machine Learning Basics with Spark MLlib

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model using Spark MLlib. The objective is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of creating a machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Objectives

- Preprocess the Iris dataset.
- Build a classification model using Spark MLlib.
- Evaluate the model's performance and interpret the results.

## Available Data Source

- [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris): A classic dataset for classification tasks.

## Files in This Project

- **ml_pipeline.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the machine learning pipeline.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages to run the project.
- **iris_dataset.csv**: CSV file containing the Iris dataset for model training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required packages using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ml_pipeline.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Reference Materials
