# Project 3: Implementing Data Governance

## Overview
This project focuses on establishing data governance practices within Databricks using Unity Catalog. Data governance ensures that data is managed properly and complies with regulations, enabling secure and efficient data access and management across the organization.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to implement a robust data governance framework that includes access control, data lineage, and auditing capabilities. This will enhance the overall data management strategy and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

## Available Data Source
- Use any dataset from previous projects, such as the **Sales Transactions Dataset** or **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset**. This allows us to demonstrate data governance practices on real data.

## Project Description
In this project, we will carry out the following tasks:

1. **Setting Up Unity Catalog**:
   - Create a Unity Catalog metastore to manage data access and governance.
   - Define catalogs, schemas, and tables to organize datasets effectively.

2. **Data Access Control**:
   - Implement fine-grained access control by assigning permissions to users and groups.
   - Create roles to manage user access to sensitive data based on their responsibilities.

3. **Data Lineage**:
   - Enable data lineage tracking to visualize data flow and transformations across different datasets.
   - Use Unity Catalog features to track the origin of data and its lifecycle.

4. **Auditing and Compliance**:
   - Implement auditing mechanisms to log access and modifications to datasets.
   - Generate compliance reports to ensure adherence to data governance policies.

5. **Best Practices for Data Governance**:
   - Document best practices for data management, access control, and governance within the organization.
   - Provide guidelines for maintaining data quality and compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive Databricks notebook showcasing:
  - The setup of Unity Catalog and its components.
  - Successful implementation of access controls and user roles.
  - Visualization of data lineage and auditing processes.
  - Documentation of best practices for ongoing data governance efforts.

## Requirements
- **Databricks Account**: Ensure you have access to a Databricks workspace with Unity Catalog enabled.
- **Permissions**: Administrative privileges may be required to configure Unity Catalog and manage user roles.

## Running the Project
1. **Unity Catalog Setup**:
   - Follow the Unity Catalog documentation to create a metastore and define catalogs and schemas.
   - Upload and organize datasets into the appropriate locations in the Unity Catalog.

2. **Access Control Implementation**:
   - Define user roles and permissions according to organizational policies.
   - Apply access controls to the datasets based on the roles defined.

3. **Data Lineage and Auditing**:
   - Enable lineage tracking in Unity Catalog and explore the lineage of selected datasets.
   - Set up auditing to log data access and modifications and generate compliance reports.

4. **Best Practices Documentation**:
   - Document the governance practices implemented and guidelines for future reference.
