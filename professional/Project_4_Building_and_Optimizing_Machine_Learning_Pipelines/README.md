# Project 4: Building and Optimizing Machine Learning Pipelines

## Overview
This project focuses on building and optimizing a machine learning pipeline using MLflow within the Databricks environment. The goal is to streamline the machine learning workflow from data preparation to model deployment, ensuring efficient management of experiments, models, and deployment processes.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning pipeline that demonstrates the entire lifecycle of a machine learning model, including:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Model tracking and logging with MLflow
- Deployment of the trained model

## Available Data Source
- [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud): This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, making it ideal for classification tasks and testing various machine learning algorithms.

## Project Description
The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Ingestion and Preparation**:
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file or a Databricks table.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify key features.
   - Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing/standardizing features, and creating new features as needed.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Select and engineer features that improve model performance.
   - Use techniques such as one-hot encoding, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) as appropriate.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Implement cross-validation to ensure the robustness of model evaluations.

4. **Model Tracking with MLflow**:
   - Use MLflow to log parameters, metrics, and models during the training process.
   - Create a dashboard in MLflow to visualize model performance and compare different runs.

5. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the best-performing model using MLflowâ€™s model serving capabilities.
   - Create a REST API endpoint to serve predictions on new data.

6. **Optimization and Performance Tuning**:
   - Explore hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search.
   - Implement techniques to improve model performance and reduce inference time.

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive Databricks notebook showcasing:
  - Complete data processing and preparation steps.
  - Trained machine learning models with logged parameters and performance metrics.
  - Visualization of model performance using MLflow.
  - A deployed model serving predictions through a REST API.
