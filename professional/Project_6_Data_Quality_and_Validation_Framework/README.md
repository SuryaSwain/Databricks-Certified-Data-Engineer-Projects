# Project 6: Data Quality and Validation Framework

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a comprehensive data quality and validation framework using Apache Spark within the Databricks environment. The aim is to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of data processed in your data engineering workflows.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a framework that:
- Automates data quality checks across various datasets.
- Validates data against defined rules and standards.
- Provides comprehensive reporting on data quality issues.

## Available Data Source
- **Dataset**: Use any dataset from previous projects or select a publicly available dataset such as:
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
  - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Project Description
The project involves the following key components:

1. **Data Quality Framework Setup**:
   - Define data quality metrics such as completeness, consistency, accuracy, uniqueness, and timeliness.
   - Create a configuration file or parameters to specify quality checks.

2. **Data Validation Rules**:
   - Implement validation rules for different data types and structures (e.g., string length, numerical ranges, date formats).
   - Use Spark DataFrame APIs to create custom validation functions.

3. **Automated Quality Checks**:
   - Build a suite of automated checks that run on incoming datasets to assess quality.
   - Integrate these checks into data processing pipelines within Databricks.

4. **Reporting Mechanism**:
   - Develop a reporting system that logs the results of quality checks, highlighting any issues found.
   - Utilize Databricks SQL to create dashboards that visualize data quality metrics over time.

5. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Implement a feedback mechanism to alert data engineers and analysts about data quality issues in real time.
   - Allow for manual interventions and adjustments based on the reported issues.

## Expected Outcomes
- A robust data quality and validation framework that:
  - Automatically checks and validates datasets against defined quality rules.
  - Generates reports and alerts for any data quality issues identified.
  - Visualizes data quality metrics to help in monitoring and decision-making.

## Requirements
- **Databricks Account**: Ensure you have access to a Databricks workspace.
- **Dataset**: Have a dataset ready for quality assessment.

## Running the Project
1. **Set Up Data Quality Metrics**:
   - Define and configure data quality metrics to be assessed.

2. **Implement Validation Rules**:
   - Create validation functions and integrate them into the data processing workflow.

3. **Automate Quality Checks**:
   - Schedule automated quality checks as part of the ETL processes.

4. **Build Reporting Mechanism**:
   - Develop a reporting system to log and visualize data quality results.

5. **Test and Validate Framework**:
   - Run the framework against various datasets to ensure its effectiveness and accuracy.
