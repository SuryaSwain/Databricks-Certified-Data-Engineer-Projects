# Project 8: Data Lakehouse Architecture Implementation

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a data lakehouse architecture using Databricks and Delta Lake. The goal is to combine the best features of data lakes and data warehouses, providing a unified solution for storing, managing, and analyzing both structured and unstructured data.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Understand the concepts of data lakehouse architecture and its advantages over traditional data architectures.
- Implement a scalable data lakehouse architecture in Databricks using Delta Lake.
- Showcase data ingestion, storage, management, and analytics capabilities within the lakehouse framework.

## Available Data Sources
- **Structured Data**: Use datasets like:
  - [Air Quality Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality) (CSV format).
- **Unstructured Data**: Utilize datasets such as:
  - [Public Tweets Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) (JSON format).
  
## Project Description
The project will be executed in the following steps:

1. **Architecture Design**:
   - Create a high-level design of the data lakehouse architecture, highlighting the integration of data lakes and warehouses.
   - Identify components such as data ingestion, storage (Delta Lake), processing (Spark), and analytics (SQL, BI tools).

2. **Setup Databricks Environment**:
   - Set up a Databricks workspace and create necessary clusters for development and testing.
   - Ensure access to Delta Lake features within the Databricks environment.

3. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Implement data ingestion pipelines to bring both structured and unstructured data into the lakehouse.
   - Use Spark jobs to read data from various sources (e.g., CSV, JSON) and store it in Delta Lake tables.

4. **Data Storage and Management**:
   - Utilize Delta Lake's features, such as ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel, to manage the data efficiently.
   - Organize data into structured tables and unstructured data stores within the lakehouse.

5. **Data Processing and Analytics**:
   - Perform data transformations using Spark SQL and DataFrames.
   - Create dashboards and visualizations using Databricks SQL or third-party BI tools to analyze the ingested data.

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize the lakehouse for performance by applying best practices for partitioning, caching, and indexing.
   - Evaluate the performance of queries and data processing jobs.

7. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Document the architecture, data flow, and processing steps in detail.
   - Prepare a report summarizing the findings, challenges faced, and recommendations for future enhancements.

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional data lakehouse architecture implemented in Databricks, showcasing:
  - Seamless data ingestion and management of both structured and unstructured data.
  - High performance in data processing and analytics.
  - Robust data governance and compliance with data management best practices.
