# Project 1: Advanced Data Ingestion Techniques

## Overview
This project aims to implement advanced data ingestion strategies using Apache Kafka in conjunction with Databricks. By leveraging real-time streaming capabilities, we will create a robust data ingestion pipeline that efficiently captures, processes, and stores data for further analysis.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the integration of Kafka and Databricks for real-time data ingestion and processing. We will explore how to set up Kafka, produce data streams, and consume those streams using Databricks, focusing on best practices for streaming data management.

## Available Data Sources
- **Simulated Kafka Stream**: Generate synthetic data to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Public Streaming Dataset**: Utilize datasets available through public APIs or repositories that provide streaming capabilities.

## Project Description
In this project, we will perform the following tasks:

1. **Set Up Kafka Environment**:
   - Install and configure Apache Kafka on a local or cloud-based server.
   - Create a Kafka topic to facilitate data ingestion.
   - Implement a Kafka producer that generates and pushes streaming data to the topic. This could involve random data generation or reading from a predefined dataset.

2. **Databricks Configuration**:
   - Create a Databricks workspace and set up a new notebook.
   - Utilize the Spark Structured Streaming API to connect to the Kafka topic and read incoming data streams.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Perform real-time transformations on the incoming data, such as filtering, aggregating, or enriching the data.
   - Implement window operations to analyze data over time intervals.

4. **Store and Visualize Results**:
   - Write the processed data to Delta Lake for efficient storage and querying.
   - Optionally, create real-time dashboards within Databricks to visualize the streaming data and insights gained from the transformations.

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive Databricks notebook showcasing:
  - Successful ingestion of real-time data from Kafka.
  - Detailed transformations applied to the streaming data.
  - Insights derived from the processed data, visualized through charts or dashboards.

## Reference Materials
- [Integrating Kafka with Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/kafka/index.html)
- [Spark Structured Streaming Programming Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html)
- [Apache Kafka Documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)
- [Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/)

## Requirements
- **Apache Kafka**: Ensure Kafka is installed and configured correctly.
- **Databricks Account**: A Databricks account with appropriate permissions to create notebooks and clusters.
- **Libraries**: Ensure that Python, Spark, and any required libraries (e.g., `pyspark`, `kafka-python`) are installed in the Databricks environment.

## Running the Project
1. **Kafka Setup**:
   - Start the Kafka server and create a new topic for data ingestion.
   - Run the Kafka producer to begin generating and sending data to the topic.

2. **Databricks Execution**:
   - Open the Databricks notebook created for this project.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to establish a connection to Kafka, ingest the data, process it, and store the results.

3. **Monitoring and Visualization**:
   - Monitor the streaming job in Databricks to ensure that data is being processed in real-time.
   - Explore visualizations created from the processed data to gain insights.
