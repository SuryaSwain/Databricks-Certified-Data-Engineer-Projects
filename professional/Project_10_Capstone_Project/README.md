# Project 10: Capstone Project

## Overview
The Capstone Project serves as a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout your data engineering studies. It integrates various concepts, tools, and techniques to solve a real-world data problem or to create a comprehensive data solution. This project showcases your ability to design, implement, and optimize data pipelines and analytics frameworks.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this Capstone Project are to:
- Identify a meaningful data challenge or opportunity that can benefit from a robust data engineering solution.
- Design and implement an end-to-end data pipeline, including data ingestion, processing, storage, and visualization.
- Utilize best practices in data engineering to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance.
- Demonstrate proficiency with modern data technologies and tools.

## Project Description
This project will be carried out in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Problem Identification
- **Define the Problem Statement**: Clearly articulate the data problem or opportunity.
- **Scope the Project**: Determine the project scope, objectives, and success criteria.

### Phase 2: Data Collection
- **Data Sources**: Identify and acquire relevant datasets. These may include:
  - Publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle, government databases).
  - APIs (e.g., Twitter API, weather data).
- **Data Ingestion**: Use tools like Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, or Airflow to ingest data from various sources.

### Phase 3: Data Processing
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Implement data preprocessing steps to clean and transform raw data into a usable format.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Build efficient ETL pipelines using Apache Spark, Apache Beam, or similar frameworks.
- **Delta Lake or Data Lakehouse**: Utilize Delta Lake or a data lakehouse architecture for storage and processing.

### Phase 4: Data Storage
- **Data Warehouse**: Store processed data in a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Amazon Redshift).
- **Data Lake**: Alternatively, consider using a data lake (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for unstructured or semi-structured data.

### Phase 5: Data Visualization and Analysis
- **Create Dashboards**: Utilize tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Apache Superset to create interactive dashboards for data visualization.
- **Data Analytics**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and present insights derived from the data.

### Phase 6: Documentation and Presentation
- **Technical Documentation**: Document the entire data pipeline, including architecture diagrams, data flow, and code explanations.
- **Final Presentation**: Prepare a presentation summarizing the project objectives, methodology, findings, and conclusions.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Ingestion**: Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, or Apache Airflow
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark, Apache Beam
- **Storage**: Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, AWS S3
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Apache Superset
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functioning data pipeline capable of handling real-world data challenges.
- Comprehensive documentation and a presentation that effectively communicates the project's objectives and results.
- Hands-on experience with data engineering tools and techniques, preparing you for real-world applications.
