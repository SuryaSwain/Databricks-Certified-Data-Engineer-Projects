# Project 7: Batch vs. Streaming Processing Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to compare and analyze batch processing and streaming processing methodologies using Apache Spark within the Databricks environment. By examining both approaches, we will evaluate their performance, latency, and suitability for various data processing use cases.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Implement a use case that processes the same dataset using both batch and streaming processing.
- Analyze the performance differences, including processing time, resource utilization, and output accuracy.
- Provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each processing method.

## Available Data Source
- **Dataset**: Use a dataset suitable for both batch and streaming processing, such as:
  - [NYC Taxi Trip Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) (for batch processing)
  - Simulated streaming data generated from the above dataset or any public streaming dataset (e.g., [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)).

## Project Description
The project will be executed in the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset for consistency and accuracy.
   - Ensure that the dataset is available in both batch and streaming formats.

2. **Batch Processing Implementation**:
   - Develop a Spark job to process the data in batch mode.
   - Perform transformations and aggregations, storing the results in a suitable format (e.g., Delta Lake).

3. **Streaming Processing Implementation**:
   - Set up a Spark Structured Streaming job to process the same data in real-time.
   - Use a simulated data source (e.g., Kafka or socket stream) to feed data continuously for processing.

4. **Performance Metrics Collection**:
   - Collect performance metrics such as processing time, throughput, and resource utilization for both methods.
   - Record any anomalies or issues encountered during processing.

5. **Analysis and Reporting**:
   - Analyze the results to compare the performance of batch vs. streaming processing.
   - Create visualizations to represent the differences in processing times and other metrics.

6. **Conclusion and Recommendations**:
   - Provide insights into the circumstances under which each processing method is preferable.
   - Suggest best practices for implementing batch and streaming processing based on findings.

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive analysis report detailing:
  - Performance comparisons of batch and streaming processing.
  - Use case scenarios for each processing method.
  - Recommendations for data engineers on selecting the appropriate processing approach based on specific requirements.
