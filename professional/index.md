# Databricks Certified Data Engineer Professional Projects

## Introduction

The Databricks Certified Data Engineer Professional certification ensures proficiency in creating, optimizing, and managing data pipelines using Databricks. These hands-on projects are designed to mirror key skills required for the certification:

- **Advanced Data Ingestion**: Implement scalable, efficient data ingestion strategies.
- **Complex ETL Pipelines**: Build reliable ETL processes with Delta Lake.
- **Data Governance**: Implement frameworks for governance to ensure data quality and compliance.
- **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Develop and optimize ML pipelines for real-time analytics.
- **Data Lakehouse Architecture**: Combine the best of data lakes and data warehouses to form a lakehouse architecture.

Each project will help solidify your practical knowledge, directly preparing you for the certification and enhancing your capabilities as a professional data engineer.

## Objective

The objective of this project series is to provide hands-on experience in creating, managing, and optimizing data pipelines using Databricks, preparing data engineers to efficiently handle large-scale data processing tasks. By completing these projects, you will be able to:

- Develop robust, real-time data ingestion pipelines.
- Build and optimize ETL workflows using Delta Lake for data consistency and performance.
- Implement frameworks for data quality and governance to maintain compliance and reliability.
- Create and optimize machine learning pipelines that support real-time data analytics.
- Apply data lakehouse architecture principles to integrate data lakes and data warehouses effectively.
