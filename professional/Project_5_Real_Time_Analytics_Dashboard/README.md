# Project 5: Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a real-time analytics dashboard using Databricks SQL and visualization tools. The goal is to provide actionable insights through live data visualizations, allowing stakeholders to monitor key metrics and trends as they happen.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a real-time analytics dashboard that:
- Integrates streaming data from various sources.
- Visualizes key metrics and KPIs in real-time.
- Enables users to make data-driven decisions quickly.

## Available Data Source
- **Streaming Data Source**: Use streaming data from Project 1 (Advanced Data Ingestion Techniques) or any other suitable real-time data source such as:
  - [Public Streaming Data Sources](https://www.data.gov/)
  - Simulated sensor data or logs from a Kafka stream.

## Project Description
The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Set up a data ingestion pipeline to stream data from a chosen source (e.g., Kafka, REST API).
   - Use Spark Structured Streaming in Databricks to ingest and process the data in real-time.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the incoming data streams, ensuring it is in a suitable format for analysis.
   - Perform any necessary aggregations, calculations, or transformations to derive meaningful insights.

3. **Creating Visualizations**:
   - Utilize Databricks SQL to create various visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables to represent key metrics (e.g., user activity, sales trends, sensor readings).
   - Design the dashboard layout to ensure ease of navigation and readability.

4. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Set up a real-time dashboard using Databricksâ€™ built-in dashboard capabilities.
   - Configure refresh intervals for the dashboard to ensure data is updated regularly.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - Implement filters and controls to allow users to customize the dashboard view (e.g., date range, specific metrics).
   - Enable drill-down capabilities to view detailed data behind the visualizations.

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional real-time analytics dashboard that:
  - Visualizes live data streams and key performance indicators (KPIs).
  - Provides insights into trends and patterns in the data.
  - Allows users to interact with the data through filters and controls.

## Requirements
- **Databricks Account**: Ensure you have access to a Databricks workspace.
- **Streaming Data Source**: Set up a streaming data source such as Kafka or a public API for ingestion.

## Running the Project
1. **Set Up Data Ingestion**:
   - Configure the streaming data source and set up a Spark Structured Streaming job to ingest the data.

2. **Process Data**:
   - Clean and preprocess the streaming data as it flows into Databricks.

3. **Create Visualizations**:
   - Use Databricks SQL to create visualizations based on the processed data.

4. **Develop the Dashboard**:
   - Design and implement the dashboard, incorporating visualizations and user interaction features.

5. **Deploy and Test**:
   - Deploy the dashboard and test its functionality with live data streams to ensure performance and accuracy.
