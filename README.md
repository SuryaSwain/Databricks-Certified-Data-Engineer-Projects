## Overview

The Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate certification focuses on data engineering skills using Databricks and Apache Spark. 
This certification evaluates the ability to perform data analysis, build data pipelines, and implement ETL processes using Databricks. 

The Professional certification delves deeper into advanced topics such as machine learning, data governance, and complex ETL processes. 

This repository aims to provide practical experience through various projects aligned with the certification requirements.
